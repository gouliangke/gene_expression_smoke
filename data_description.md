Gene expression patterns were assessed in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) from a typical "full flavor" American brand of cigarettes in order to develop a better understanding of the genomic impact of tobacco exposure, which can ultimately define biomarkers that discriminate tobacco-related effects and outcomes in a clinical setting. NHBE cells were treated with CS for 15 minutes and alterations to the transcriptome assessed at 1,2,4 and 24 hours post-CS-exposure using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Experiment Overall Design: Cells were exposed to smoke or air (“mock-exposed”) for 15 min, after which they were refed with fresh media and allowed to incubate for 1h, 2h, 4h or 24h. Smoke and mock samples were compared at each time point.
